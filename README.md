## What is This Mini-App?

This **Progressive Web App (PWA)** and **mini-app** (e.g., Farcaster client) allows cities to create virtual districts where the public can interact in a way that's both informative and engaging. It’s designed to promote creative district outreach, facilitate survey data collection for **Creative District Certification**, and encourage participation from the community.

Our first city partner is **Minatare, Nebraska**, where we are helping establish and administer a Creative District to revitalize their downtown, attract new residents, and foster economic development through the arts.

### Features:

* **Customizable via .env and image files**: Easy customization for different cities and use cases.
* **Community Engagement**: Provides simple ways to connect businesses and events to the community, all in-map.
* **Fundraising & Transparency**: Streamline fundraising efforts and live-stream meetings directly on the map.
* **Continual Development**: Features are continually developed based on feedback to ensure equal access and value for public good.

## How It Works

This app leverages **interactive map data**, making it easy for communities to build and explore creative districts. Users can collect survey data, interact with city events, and access fundraising campaigns in one seamless interface.

### Main Features:

* **Map Data**: Publicly accessible data for city planning and development.
* **Event and Business Info**: Connect community businesses and events interactively on the map.
